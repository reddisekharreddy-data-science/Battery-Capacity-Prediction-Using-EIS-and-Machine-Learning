**Battery Capacity Prediction Using EIS and Machine Learning**

This project focuses on analyzing Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data to predict battery capacity using machine learning techniques. The notebook provides a comprehensive workflow from data extraction to modeling and visualization.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The notebook includes the following key steps:

1. **Extract and Load Data**  
   Loading and preprocessing of raw EIS and capacity data for analysis.

2. **3D Visualization of Impedance Data**  
   Plotting the EIS data in three dimensions to understand frequency response and impedance patterns.

3. **Incremental Capacity Analysis**  
   Performing dQ/dV analysis to assess changes in battery capacity.

4. **Machine Learning Model**  
   Using machine learning to predict battery capacity from EIS features.
